Node.js HTTP Server
This is a simple Node.js HTTP server that provides two endpoints: /books and /authors. The server uses basic authentication to protect these endpoints.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run node index.js to start the server.
Usage
The server provides two endpoints:

GET /books: Returns a JSON object with a list of books.
GET /authors: Returns a JSON object with a list of authors.
Both endpoints require authentication. You need to send a GET request with a JSON body containing username and password properties.

For example:

Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual username and password.
